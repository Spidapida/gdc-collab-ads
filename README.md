# Setting Up

1. Execute `initialize.yag` one time through YAGPDB's CC dashboard and Discord. If you cannot execute the whole command due to the character limit, split up the CC into two.
2. Add `initialform.yag`, `buttons 1.yag`, `buttons 2.yag`, `modals.yag`, `submitmedia.yag` through YAGDPB's CC dashboard page, then set their appropriate trigger types, found on their respective files. Configurables can be changed there as well.
