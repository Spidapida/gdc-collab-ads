{{$aaa2 := print `## Welcome to the Collab Network!
This is a place where collaboration hosts, gameplay specialists, decorators, mergers, and verifiers can find one another! For those who don't know, a **collaboration** ("collab" for short) is a level built through a conjoined effort of more than one creator. **Megacollabs** are large collabs that consist of roughly 5+ people, and **ultracollabs** are massive collabs that consist of roughly 20+ people. 
### The Channels:
- <#1121790684496675006> is a designated space for members that are <@&674754528381239330> or <@&972856066809401396> and above to post their recruitment advertisements, as a reward for very actively participating in our community. We anticipate these ads to get more traffic, as fewer people are competing for the space.
- <#1121781271887106168>  is the lite version of this, and is free for everyone to use. We are excited to see this resource limitlessly bring creators together, but due to this change, we have to ask a few things of you in order to keep it as viable of a resource as possible for everyone.
- <#1146847063020142602> is for those who want to ask for help not with *creating* their level, but *playing* their level. This is a dedicated space for creators seeking direct, specific feedback about issues with their level's gameplay, which may include finding a verifier.

### Playtest Request Guidelines:
1. Your level should be finished. You can get feedback on layouts and unfinished gameplay in [‚Å†here](https://discord.com/channels/643089441463992340/643112753669734401).
2. Your level should either be publicly playable, or you should expect to add people to your friends list as they reach out to you so they can play it unlisted.
3. Your direct messages should be open to members of this server. All inquiries other than the original post should take place in direct messages.
4. Every message in https://discord.com/channels/643089441463992340/1146847063020142602 should focus on a single level that you created or hosted and follow the format below!

### Playtest Request Format:
` "```" `Level Name:
Level ID:
Video:
Briefly describe the level and your vision for it. Make notes here about issues you already know about, or quirks that are intentional` "```" `
### Advertisement Guidelines:
1. Your ad should *focus on a singular level* that you and your team are working on. Creator teams should only be mentioned as a requirement to become a participant in the level your ad focuses on; __NOT__ by themselves.
2. Your ad should promote a level *you are the host of*. This is to ensure that any given level may only be advertised by __one__ person, to prevent slowmode abuse. A **host** is the leader and organizer of a collaborative effort, who oversees all progress and assembly of parts, and assumes authority over the level's creative vision and direction. For levels with multiple hosts, communicate amongst yourselves as to who will do the advertising in each available channel.
3. All posts in advertising channels must be genuine standalone collaboration advertisements. Any other kind promotion is not allowed.
4. Your ad should *include sufficient information*.

### Notes in posting your collab ad:`}}
